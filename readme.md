# Rectify
A clone of a game which name is forgotten. I have played it on my friend's Nokia phone 5+ years ago.

## System Requirements
**OS:** Windows, Linux, OSX and so on. All supported systems are listed [here](https://www.love2d.org/).
**Hardware:** Basically any home computer manufactured in the 21th century.

## Rules
Form a big, individual (disconnected from other blocks) rectangle to eliminate blocks.
When any block reaches the bottom red line, you lose.
The game board will get larger as you move on. (more difficult)

## Controls
**Launch holded blocks (shown in the bottom right):** `space` or `primary mouse button`

**Rotate blocks clockwise:** `up` or `secondary mouse button`

**Rotate blocks counter-clockwise:** `down`


## Known Problems
- it takes a long time to wait a block coming down if you clear the blocks fast
- window will flash on resize
- sometimes when you launch your blocks in a wrong position, you are doomed to lose

## Thoughts
Remember! Index of lua arrays starts from 1, not 0!
